# Pivot Tester

## Note:
This is a small script and supporting RSpec test written as an answer to a
technical challenge posed when applying for a job.

## The problem:
Write a method that returns the "pivot" index of a list of integers. We define
the pivot index as the index where the sum of the numbers on the left is equal
to the sum of the numbers on the right. Given [1, 4, 6, 3, 2], the method should
return 2, since the sum of the numbers to the left of index 2 is equal to the
sum of numbers to the right of index 2 (1 + 4 = 3 + 2). If no such index exists,
it should return -1. If there are multiple pivots, you can return the left-most
pivot.

Make sure that the method:

- Runs successfully
- Handles all edge cases
- Is as efficient as you can make it
